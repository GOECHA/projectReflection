 ## **Objective**
 *Create functioning web page that includes:*
 - Randomize reload feature
 - Functioning button element
 - Text box element with Data entry
 - Create element for the user to create a combination of image input and innerText
 - Save feature allowing a user to save either random image or created image
 - View feature to view a created image
 - Delete feature using an event listener by creating an event handler to associate image by id.

 **This Deployment**
Used a package of images, javaScript, HTML, and CSS files. The package was used in a team of developers that used Git Hub to collaborate by pushing and pulling a project repository. The team met over zoom and collaborated on the functionality of the deployment by manipulating an interface with codes that required a class constructor, randomizer function, event listeners, event handlers, functions that were able to hide and add aesthetic visuals and functioning elements that a user would use to easily navigate a web page. As a team we executed challenges and used javaScript to manipulate the existing CSS and HTML files within the deployment package.


## **Overall**

- The challenge I had with a team mate was trying to avoid being steamrolled. As a brand new developer, I am learning how to code and also communicate what questions I have when learning a new language of coding and how to execute. This project enlightened my perspective on how to speak up and articulate what information I still need to process how code is being executed.
  I was fortunate to have 2 other partners for this project as a group of 3. As a team we filled out a DTR and set guidelines to move forward. My team was aware that I need to be more involved with the coding process. When there were times that the others were moving fast, I made a point to speak up and ask questions on the process. When I needed clarification, we switched roles and used the driver/navigator technique. Where I would drive the code as the navigator would guide the code int he right direction. This also helped so I could re explain the process to other developers.

  ## **Technical**

  - The team was struggling trying to find out how to display two taglines under a book title. At first we were attempting to divide and conquer. Then we started the roll of driver navigator. I was the driver and my navigator guided me through how to display an image and Main text for the deployment. Once I was clear on the objective, I used HTML knowledge to use an id to select two taglines. Resolving the issue.


  ## **Reflection**

  - I enjoy working in groups, this experience has taught me that I can reach out and ask questions. I can lean on cohort mates, rocks, mentors, and anyone else that has faced this challenge in the past.

    From this project as a developer I have learned that is it possible to create an event listener in the future, as long as you follow the rules of control flow.

    For the next project, I would like to focus more on looking to the web to figure things out. I liked the collaboration of this project, but it would be nice to be able to work separately when schedules don't match up.
