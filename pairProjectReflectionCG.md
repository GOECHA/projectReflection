 ## **Objective**
 *Create functioning web page that includes:*
 - Randomize reload feature
 - Functioning button element
 - Text box element with Data entry
 - Create element for the user to create a combination of image input and innerText
 - Save feature allowing a user to save either random image or created image
 - View feature to view a created image
 - Delete feature using an event listener by creating an event handler to associate image by id.

 **This Deployment**
Used a package of images, javaScript, HTML, and CSS files. The package was used in a team of developers that used Git Hub to collaborate by pushing and pulling a project repository. The team met over zoom and collaborated on the functionality of the deployment by manipulating an interface with codes that required a class constructor, randomizer function, event listeners, event handlers, functions that were able to hide and add aesthetic visuals and functioning elements that a user would use to easily navigate a web page. As a team we executed challenges and used javaScript to manipulate the existing CSS and HTML files within the deployment package.


## **Overall**

- The challenge I had with a team mate was trying to avoid being steamrolled. As a brand new developer, I am learning how to code and also communicate what questions I have when learning a new language of coding and how to execute. This project enlightened my perspective on how to speak up and articulate what information I still need to process how code is being executed.
  I was fortunate to have 2 other partners for this project as a group of 3. As a team we filled out a DTR and set guidelines to move forward. My team was aware that I need to be more involved with the coding process. When there were times that the others were moving fast, I made a point to speak up and ask questions on the process. When I needed clarification, we switched roles and used the driver/navigator technique. Where I would drive the code as the navigator would guide the code int he right direction. This also helped so I could re explain the process to other developers.

  ## **Technical**

  - The team was struggling trying to find out how to display two taglines under a book title. At first we were attempting to divide and conquer. Then we started the roll of driver navigator. I was the driver and my navigator guided me through how to display an image and Main text for the deployment. Once I was clear on the objective, I used HTML knowledge to use an id to select two taglines. Resolving the issue.


  ## **Reflection**

  - I enjoy working in groups, this experience has taught me that I can reach out and ask questions. I can lean on cohort mates, rocks, mentors, and anyone else that has faced this challenge in the past.

    From this project as a developer I have learned that is it possible to create an event listener in the future, as long as you follow the rules of control flow.

    For the next project, I would like to focus more on looking to the web to figure things out. I liked the collaboration of this project, but it would be nice to be able to work separately when schedules don't match up.

 ## **Objective**
 *Create functioning web page that includes:*
 - Randomize reload feature
 - Functioning button elements
 - Limit to saving elements
 - Save feature allowing a user to save random generated swatches
 - Hide feature/button to hide previously saved items
 - Delete feature using an event listener by creating an event handler to associate image by id.

## **Overall**
- I take the role of designer in a team and manager
- In this project I was the mosquito in everyone's ear reminding everyone to push their projects up to gitHub after every function or modification to the project. My thinking is about when we receive errors the team can go back to a place when a feature was functioning and revert back in time to address where functionality became non-fucntioning. When we were finishing the last steps of the project a non functioning part of the proejct was merged to main. I went back to a branch we were working on in the morning that was functioning before the merge and we were able to recover "lost" items in our code.

- I also designed the page so we could tackle the formatting and know where to place our items in CSS. We as a group went over specs after a mock up was approved.

## **Technical**
- We could not find a solution for the delete function and everything was a struggle. We reached out to everyone's rocks, mentors, fellow co-hort mates, used google, stack-overflow, past personal projects, anything we could reach virtually or physically. When there were errors we used DevTools and console.log to test and trouble shoot what the issue may have been.
We found the problem and cracked the code. 
   
## **Reflection**
- This project helped me with a rythym and flow for order of operations when building a webspace. I saw other ways to start building an HTML doc and CSS file. I also, learned that Classes belong on separate pages. 
- We also had an error with our deployment page, and I learned the importance of referencing js files in HTML and that one "." will cause technical chaos. Easy fix, when using dev tools to pinpoint an exact location in a file with incorrect syntax.
